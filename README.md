Background
=========

This repository is meant to host my data science related
observations. I'm a relatively recent data science enthusiast and I
would like to try to understand various aspects of data science and/or
statistics.

The observations are intended in the form of jupyter notebooks as I
find jupyter notebooks the most efficient method for me to toy around
with concepts and to do exploratory data analysis.
